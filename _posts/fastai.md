## 1. Background {#Background}

Fastai is an open source project created by Jeremy Howard and Sylvain Gugger, aimed at providing easy-to-use advanced APIs and tools to make deep learning easier to get started and implement.

This project started in 2017 and was initially created to support an online course. With the success and rapid development of the course, the Fastai project has begun to attract more developers and users. The fastai library is built on the basis of PyTorch and provides advanced APIs and pre trained models, simplifying the implementation process of deep learning tasks. This year, Fastai released its first version (v0.7).

Later, the project successively released versions of Fastai v1, v2, and v2.3, introducing many new features and improvements, providing better performance and scalability, providing more pre trained models and tools, educational resources, and practical examples.

In the development process of Fastai, it not only provides easy-to-use entry-level tools for beginners in deep learning, but also provides rich functionality and flexibility for professional researchers and practitioners. The goal of Fastai is to make deep learning more universal and accessible, helping more people use deep learning to solve practical problems. At the same time, Fastai also promotes the development of deep learning education and the dissemination of knowledge through curriculum, documentation, and community building.
