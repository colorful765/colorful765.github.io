**_Hello and welcome to this blog!!_**

I am a student at The University of Queensland and it is my first time write blog and learn how to use GitHub. I have recently started to learn fastai and the purpose of this blog is simply to introduce myself and record my learning process.

My course advisor is Dr. Brian Lovell, who is an excellent teacher who has provided me with a lot of guidance and assistance in my studies. This is his blog link, and I believe you can also learn a lot from it.
